1. I read the source code and saw that the database credentials are stored in the cookie
2. I did a reverse md5 lookup of the signature of the cookie and found that the root password is x (http://md5.gromweb.com/)
3. Created my own mysql database in db4free.net. Put a table users with an entry gotilio / gotilio
4. Created the config string for the cookie with the connection parameters to my database
5. Calculated the hash of the lower case of my cookie and edited the cookies on the browser with "EditThisCookie"
6. Submited my user and voila! 
7. I hate the guy who designed this problem :P (But I hate the one of the convolution even more, I suspect its the same person)
